With the adoption of a membrane separation method, cations, anions, zwitter ions and/or charge macromolecular substances in a vesica mixed suspension hydrated medium are distributed into a dialysis medium; and an ion exchanging method is used for selectively exchanging or cleaning the cations, the anions, the zwitter ions and/or the charge macromolecular substances in the dialysis medium, so that the vesica can establish the greater inner and outer water phase gradient difference in shorter time. The method and the device can be applied to preparing liposome gel, magnetic liposome, and nano grain/nano gel."

            "abstract": "Dopamine (DA)-derived tetrahydroisoquinolines (TIQs) are discussed as neurochemical factors of addiction processes in alcoholism. In a prospective study, the regional distribution of DA, (R)-salsolinol (SAL), and (S)-SAL, as well as norsalsolinol (NorSAL) was examined systematically in a large collective of human brain samples obtained by autopsy. The material comprises 44 brains of alcoholics and 47 controls with 6 standardized specimens in each case. The analytes were determined after solid-phase extraction and enantioselective derivatization using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Levels of DA, (R/S)-SAL, and NorSAL in alcoholics did not differ significantly from those of the control group. A relationship between alcohol consumption and SAL formation could not be proved. Topical differences and no ubiquitous occurrence were encountered. Significant amounts of (R)-SAL and (S)-SAL as well as NorSAL only were found in DA-rich areas of the basal ganglia, whereas in other regions of the brain, no TIQs were detected. Especially in the nucleus caudatus, the concentrations of DA, SAL, and NorSAL decreased significantly with rising age. These findings do not support the hypothesis that one of the SAL enantiomers or NorSAL is involved in the genesis of alcoholism. However, they suggest that the concentration of the substrate DA may determine the alkaloid level during in vivo formation. The revealed data can serve as reference for other studies in humans concerning the cause of alcoholism or other neurodegenerative diseases with the involvement of TIQs.",

            "abstract": "The selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is suspected to correlate with the increase of cellular iron, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD by promotion of oxidative stress. This research investigated dopamine-induced oxidative stress toxicity contributed by iron and the production of dopamine-derived neurotoxins in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. After the SH-SY5Y cells were pre-incubated with dopamine and Fe2+ for 24 h, the cell viability, hydroxyl radical, melondialdehyde, cell apoptosis, and catechol isoquinolines were measured by lactate dehydrogenase assay, salicylic acid trapping method, thiobarbuteric acid assay, Hoechst 33258 staining and HPLC-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD), respectively. (1) Optimal dopamine (150 micromol/L) and Fe2+ (40 or 80 micromol/L) significantly increased the concentrations of hydroxy radicals and melondialdehyde in SH-SY5Y cells. (2) Induction with dopamine alone or dopamine and Fe2+ (dopamine/Fe2+) caused cell apoptosis. (3) Compared with untreated cells, the catechol isoquinolines, salsolinol and N-methyl-salsolinol in dopamine/Fe2+-induced cells were detected in increasing amounts. Due to dopamine/Fe2+-induced oxidative stress similar to the state in the parkinsonian substantia nigra neurons, dopamine and Fe2+ impaired SH-SY5Y cells could be used as the cell oxidative stress model of Parkinson's disease. The catechol isoquinolines detected in cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease as potential neurotoxins.",
